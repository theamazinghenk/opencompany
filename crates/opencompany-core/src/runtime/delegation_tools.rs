//! Brain-agnostic delegation-tool primitives (issue #176, slice 2).
//!
//! The delegation *runtime* — draining a queue and running desk-lead turns —
//! lives in [`delegation`](crate::runtime::delegation) and is harness-only
//! (it needs in-process cognition). But the delegation *tools* themselves —
//! their names, their argument schemas, and the desk-lead resolver — are
//! brain-agnostic: the hosted Medulla path advertises the same tools to the
//! remote cognition service and services them device-side.
//!
//! This module holds those brain-agnostic pieces so BOTH brains share one
//! definition:
//!
//! - the canonical tool-name constants ([`SPAWN_TASK_TOOL`],
//!   [`DELEGATE_TO_DESK_TOOL`]) — the harness `orchestrator` module re-exports
//!   them so the two paths cannot drift;
//! - [`delegation_manifest_entries`], the [`ToolManifestEntry`] catalog the
//!   hosted brain registers with Medulla;
//! - [`desk_lead`], the desk-lead resolver (moved here from the harness-only
//!   [`delegation`](crate::runtime::delegation) module so the hosted path can
//!   resolve a desk's lead without the `openhuman` feature);
//! - the argument parsers ([`SpawnTaskArgs`], [`DelegateArgs`]) the host uses
//!   to service a `spawn_task` / `delegate_to_desk` tool-call frame;
//! - the hand-off **target checks** — [`reject_desk_target`] (issue #272) and,
//!   since the recursive-delegation slice, [`reject_cycle_target`] and
//!   [`reject_out_of_allowlist_target`] (issue #176). Each returns the refusal
//!   as an `Option<String>` rather than rejecting in place, so the harness tool
//!   can turn it into a `ToolResult::error` and the hosted device-side handler
//!   into a failed tool frame, from one definition.
//!
//! What is *not* here is the enforcement of delegation **depth**. That lives on
//! the harness [`DelegationQueue`](crate::harness::orchestrator::DelegationQueue),
//! because only the harness runs a desk member's turn at all: the hosted path
//! services delegation tools solely for the orchestrator's own cycle and writes
//! a durable card, so its chain is always empty. The definitions above are
//! brain-agnostic; the recursion they guard is not.
//!
//! Compiled in every build (no feature gate): the hosted brain is in the
//! default build, and the harness path re-exports from here.
